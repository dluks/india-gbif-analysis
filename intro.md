# India's Contribution to GBIF Citizen Science Data

This book examines India's comparative contributions to the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) — the world's largest open biodiversity data platform — focusing on vascular plant (tracheophyte) occurrence records (DOI: [10.15468/dl.mvrs2b](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.mvrs2b)). With ~314 million georeferenced records globally, GBIF is increasingly shaped by citizen science platforms like iNaturalist.

We explore how India's contributions compare to other countries when normalized by population, land area, and known biodiversity; where within India observations are concentrated; and what systematic biases exist in the data — from taxonomic and temporal skews to geographic coverage gaps and data source composition.

We also compare GBIF citizen science records with structured vegetation surveys from the [sPlot database](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html), and assess how India's observed species connect to the global plant trait database TRY.
